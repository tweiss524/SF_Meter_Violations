# Predicting Meter Violations in San Francisco

This project was completed in collaboration with Jeffrey Kuo, Tim Tantivilaisin, and Bryan Wang at the University of California, Berkeley, with guidance from Professor Thomas Bengtsson.

# Introduction

The objective of this project was to investigate crime in San Francisco. In particular, we decided to take an in-depth look into parking citations given throughout all of San Francisco obtained from unpaid meters in order to answer the following question: "if I do not pay the meter on a specific street $S$ during a specific time interval $T$, how likely am I to get a parking ticket?" This project aims to help the user make informed decisions about whether or not it is worth it to pay for the meter, thereby mitigating the financial consequences of failing to pay for a meter. Additionally, information about locations where meter violations are most common would be beneficial to the city, as this information would enable them to assess if tickets are being distributed fairly across neighborhoods, as well as devise more effective traffic regulations in regions where traffic violations are most common.
